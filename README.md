# Lehem_Havita_The_Game

Game for the PC platform that incorporates object-oriented programming principles and utilizes a database(mdf).
The game is my final project for "object-oriented programming" course in my first year in Computer Science Degree.
it is inspired by the TikTok trend that swept Israel in the first half of 2023.
